# Frame

<span class="inherit">[Container](#Container) > [Element](#Element)</span>

This is a simple container class allowing you to add padding, margins, and a border to a single `Element`. Mirroring the standard CSS definitions, padding is space inside the border and margin is space outside the border.

There are multiple ways to specify padding and margins. If given as a scalar, it is constant across all sides. If two values are given, they correspond to the horizontal and vertical sides. If four values are given, they correspond to `[left, top, right, bottom]`.

The `adjust` flag controls whether padding/margins are adjusted for the aspect ratio. If `true`, horizontal and vertical components are scaled so that their ratio is equal to the `child` element's aspect ratio. This yields padding/margins of constant apparent size regardless of aspect ratio. If `false`, the inputs are used as-is.

Positional arguments:
- `child` — the element to be encapsulated

Keyword arguments:
- `padding` = `0` — the padding to be added (inside border)
- `margin` = `0` — the margin to be added (outside border)
- `border` = `0` — the border width to use
- `adjust` = `true` — whether to adjust values for aspect ratio
- `flex` = `false` — if `true`, do *not* inherit `child` aspect ratio
- `shape` = `Rect` — the shape class to use for the border

Subunit names:
- `border` — keywords to pass to border, such as `stroke` or `stroke_dasharray`
