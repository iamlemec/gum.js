# SymPath

<span class="inherit">Polyline > Pointstring > [Element](#Element)</span>

Flexible interface to generate two-dimensional paths symbolically or in combination with fixed inputs. There are variety of acceptable input combinations, but the most common usage is to specify the range to use for x-values with `xlim` and a function to plot with `fy`.

Alternatively, you can specify the transpose with `ylim`/`fx`, or even do a fully parametric path using `tlim`/`fx`/`fy`. In any of these cases, one can either specify limits with `xlim`/`ylim`/`tlim` or specific values with `xvals`/`yvals`/`tvals`.

You'll often want to use [Plot](#Plot) to display these curves, as they might otherwise come out looking upside down relative to what you expect (as higher y-values mean "down" in raw SVG).

Positional arguments: None

Keyword arguments:
- `fx`/`fy` — a function mapping from x-values, y-values, or t-values
- `xlim`/`ylim`/`tlim` — a pair of numbers specifying variable limits
- `xvals`/`yvals`/`tvals` — a list of x-values, y-values, or t-values to use
- `N` — number of data points to generate when using limits
