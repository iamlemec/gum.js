# UnitLine

<span class="inherit">[Line](#Line)</span>

Draw a horizontal or vertical line at a particular position over a particular range. By default the position will be `0.5` and the range will be `[0, 1]`. There are also specialized variants for vertical and horizontal lines called `VLine` and `HLine`.

Positional arguments:
- `direc` — the direction of the line (`'v'` or `'h'`)
- `pos` = `0.5` — the position of the line

Keyword arguments:
- `lim` = `[0, 1]` — the range of the line
